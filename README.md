# Forks-Counting-TG-Bot
A Telegram bot who autumatically replys you the total forks of Fedora Infra.

Replace the bot token with your own.

Run the bot, send any messages to it, and it will tell you the number of forks.

I have run the bot on my server, you can search @RepoForksBot in Telegram to check its performance :)
